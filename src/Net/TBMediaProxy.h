// The media player of iOS 6 (AVPlayer) loads streams with the system's own network stack, which cannot talk to
// YouTube's servers: they only accept current TLS ciphers. This small HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 hands the stream to
// the player through the app's network layer (TBTLSSocket) instead:
//   - HLS playlists are fetched, cleaned of the tags the 2012 player does not know and rewritten so that their
//     segments, sound renditions and nested playlists come through the proxy too,
//   - segments and MP4 files are passed on as they arrive, Range requests included (seeking), with a content type
//     read from their first bytes (YouTube's URLs have no file extension).
// URLs carry a random secret, so only what the app handed out is served.
